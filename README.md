# WebAssembly Fuzzing Corpus

> The collection of sample inputs for testing Wasm tools and runtimes.
> The [corpus] is generated by coverage-guided fuzzing tools.

## Corpus files

- [wasm](./wasm) directory contains Wasm binary modules (likely malformed
  or invalid) without any additional metadata. They are generated by fuzzing
  Wasm binary loaders and validators. These files can be used as an input to
  any tools accepting `.wasm` binary files.

## Wasm implementations

The particular versions of the fuzz-tested WebAssembly implementations.

- [Fizzy] 
   ([0.3.0](https://github.com/wasmx/fizzy/releases/v0.3.0),
    [0.5.0](https://github.com/wasmx/fizzy/releases/v0.5.0))
- [WABT]
  ([1.0.12](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt/releases/tag/1.0.12),
   [1.0.19](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt/releases/tag/1.0.19))


## Fuzzing tools

The fuzzing tools used to produce the corpus.

- [Fizzy Fuzzer] based on [libFuzzer].


## External sources

The external sources of wasm files merged to the corpus.

- [WebAssembly specification tests] - pure wasm binary files can be extracted
  from the _wast test files_ with `wast2json` tool from [WABT].
